Delayed Proof of Work</h1> <h2 id="a-foundational-discussion-of-blockchain-security"><a href="#a-foundational-discussion-of-blockchain-security" class="header-anchor">#</a> A Foundational Discussion of Blockchain Security</h2> <p>Komodo’s form of providing security is called Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW).

The latter form of security is the method utilized by the Bitcoin network.</p> <p>To understand the value of Komodo’s dPoW security, we must first explain how PoW works and why it is the most secure method of maintaining a decentralized blockchain. We must also examine PoW’s shortcomings, so that we may understand the need for Komodo’s dPoW method and the advantages it provides to the blockchain community.</p> <p>To understand how PoW technology functions, we begin by explaining the roots that make the Bitcoin protocol a viable means of securely transferring value.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-consensus-mechanism"><a href="#what-is-a-consensus-mechanism" class="header-anchor">#</a> What Is A Consensus Mechanism?</h2> <h4 id="the-double-spend-problem"><a href="#the-double-spend-problem" class="header-anchor">#</a> The &quot;Double Spend&quot; Problem</h4> <p>The creation of blockchain technology stems from the early mathematical studies of encryption using computer technology.</p> <p>One such example is related to the information-encoding device, &quot;Enigma,&quot; invented by the Germans at the end of World War I. Alan Turing, a British Intelligence agent, famously beat the Enigma device by inventing the world’s first &quot;digital computer.&quot; This provided enough computing power to break <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enigma’s<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> encryption and discover German secret communications.</p> <p>This early affair with encryption set off a race throughout the world to develop myriad forms of securely transferring information from one party to another via computer technology. While each new form of computer encryption provided more advantages, there remained one problem that prevented encryption from being useful as a means of transferring not just information, but also financial value.</p> <p>This challenge is known as the &quot;Double Spend&quot; problem. The issue lies in the ability of computers to endlessly duplicate information. In the case of financial value, there are three important things to record: who owns a specific value; the time at which the person owns this value; the wallet address in which the value resides. When transferring financial value from one person to another, it is essential that if Person A sends money to Person B, Person A should not be able to duplicate the same money and send it again to Person C.</p> <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin protocol<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>, invented by an anonymous person (or persons) claiming the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, solved the Double Spend problem. The underlying math and computer code is both highly complex and innovative. For the purposes of this paper we need only focus on the one aspect of the Bitcoin protocol that solves the Double Spend problem: the consensus mechanism.</p> <h4 id="the-consensus-mechanism-provides-security-against-a-double-spend"><a href="#the-consensus-mechanism-provides-security-against-a-double-spend" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Consensus Mechanism Provides Security Against a &quot;Double Spend&quot;</h4> <p>The consensus mechanism created by Nakamoto is perhaps one of the most powerful innovations of the twenty-first century. His invention allows individual devices to work together, using high levels of encryption, to securely and accurately track ownership of digital value (be it financial resources, digital real estate, etc.). The mechanism performs this in a manner that does not allow anyone on the same network (i.e. the Internet) to spend the same value twice.</p> <p>Let us suppose a user, Alice, indicates in her digital wallet that she wants to send cryptocurrency money to a friend. Alice’s computer now gathers several pieces of information, including any necessary permissions and passwords, the amount that Alice wants to spend, and the receiving address of her friend’s wallet. All this information is gathered into a packet of data, called a &quot;transaction,&quot; and Alice’s device sends the transaction to the Internet.</p> <p>There are several types of devices that will interact with Alice’s transaction. These devices will share the transaction information with other devices supporting the cryptocurrency network. For this discussion, we need only focus on one type of device: a cryptocurrency miner.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p> <p>The following descriptions are simplified explanations of a truly complex process. There are many other strategies cryptocurrency miners devise to out-mine their competition, and those strategies can vary widely.</p></div> <h4 id="a-miner-competes-to-add-blocks-to-the-network-s-history-in-exchange-for-a-reward"><a href="#a-miner-competes-to-add-blocks-to-the-network-s-history-in-exchange-for-a-reward" class="header-anchor">#</a> A Miner Competes to Add Blocks to the Network’s History, in Exchange for a Reward</h4> <h5 id="step-one-preparing-the-preliminary-information"><a href="#step-one-preparing-the-preliminary-information" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step One: Preparing the Preliminary Information</h5> <p>This device is performing an activity called cryptocurrency &quot;mining.&quot; Let us focus now on a mining device that captures Alice’s raw transaction data. This device is owned by a tech-savvy miner, named Bob, who wants to add Alice’s transaction to the permanent history of the Bitcoin network.</p> <p>If Bob is the first person to properly process Alice’s transaction he will receive a financial reward. One key part of this reward is a percentage-based fee, taken from Alice’s total transaction amount.</p> <h5 id="the-mempool-is-the-collection-of-all-raw-transactions-waiting-to-be-processed"><a href="#the-mempool-is-the-collection-of-all-raw-transactions-waiting-to-be-processed" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Mempool is the Collection of All Raw Transactions Waiting to be Processed</h5> <p>Furthermore, Bob does not have just one transaction alone to mine. Rather, he has an entire pool of raw transactions, created by many people across the Internet. The raw data for each of these transactions sits in the local memory bank of each miner’s mining device, awaiting the miner’s commands. Miners call this pool of transactions, the &quot;mempool.&quot; Most miners have automated systems to determine the transaction-selection process, based on estimated profit.</p> <h5 id="creating-transaction-hashes"><a href="#creating-transaction-hashes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Creating Transaction Hashes</h5> <p>After Bob makes his choices about which transactions he will attempt to mine (and we assume that he includes Alice’s transaction), Bob’s mining device then begins a series of calculations.</p> <p>His device will first take each individual transaction’s raw data and use mathematical formulas to compress the transaction into a smaller, more manageable form. This new form is called a &quot;transaction hash.&quot; For instance, Alice’s transaction hash could look like this:</p> <div class="language-bash extra-class"><pre class="language-bash"><code>b1fea52486ce0c62bb442b530a3f0132b826c74e473d1f2c220bfa78111c5082
</code></pre></div><p>Bob will prepare potentially hundreds of transaction hashes before proceeding to the next step. One important thing to understand about the compression of data in the Bitcoin protocol, including the transaction hash above, is that calculations herein obey a principle called, The Cascade Effect.</p> <h5 id="the-cascade-effect-changing-one-bit-of-data-changes-the-entire-result"><a href="#the-cascade-effect-changing-one-bit-of-data-changes-the-entire-result" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Cascade Effect: Changing One Bit of Data Changes the Entire Result</h5> <p>The Cascade Effect simply means that were Bob to attempt to change even the smallest bit in the raw data—whether from a desire to cheat, or by mistake, or for any other reason—the entire transaction hash would dramatically change. In this way, the mathematical formulas in the Bitcoin protocol ensure that Bob cannot create an improper history.</p> <p>Were Bob to attempt to create an incorrect transaction hash, other miners would discover the falseness of the hash during their automated mining process. The miners would use the same raw transaction data from Alice, perform the proper mathematical formulas in the Bitcoin protocol, and immediately discover that Bob's attempted hash was incorrect.  All the devices on the network would reject Bob’s attempt and this would prevent Bob from claiming rewards.</p> <h5 id="step-one-continued-finishing-the-preliminary-calculations"><a href="#step-one-continued-finishing-the-preliminary-calculations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step One Continued: Finishing the Preliminary Calculations</h5> <p>Now, using more mathematical formulas, Bob takes the transaction hashes he is attempting to process and compresses them into a new manageable piece of data.</p> <p>This is called, &quot;the merkle root.&quot; This represents all the transactions that Bob hopes to process, and from which he hopes to gain a reward. Bob’s merkle root could look like this:</p> <div class="language-bash extra-class"><pre class="language-bash"><code>7dac2c5666815c17a3b36427de37bb9d2e2c5ccec3f8633eb91a4205cb4c10ff
</code></pre></div><p>Finally, Bob will gather information provided from the last miner that successfully added to the permanent blockchain history. This information is called, &quot;the block header.&quot; It contains a large amount of complex data, and we won’t go into all the details. The one important element to note is that the block header gives Bob clues about how to properly add the next piece of information to the permanent Bitcoin history. One of these hints could look like this:</p> <div class="language-bash extra-class"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="token string">&quot;difficulty&quot;</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">:</span> <span class="token number">1.00000000</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We will return to this clue further on.</p> <p>Having all this information, Bob is nearly prepared. His next step is where the real challenge begins.</p> <h5 id="step-two-the-race-to-finish-first"><a href="#step-two-the-race-to-finish-first" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step Two: The Race to Finish First</h5> <p>Bob’s computer is going to gather all the above information and collect it into a set of data called a &quot;block.&quot; Mining this block and adding it to the list of blocks that came before is the process of creating a &quot;chain&quot; of blocks—hence the industry title, &quot;blockchain.&quot;</p> <p>However, adding blocks to the blockchain is not so easy. While Bob may have everything up to this point correctly prepared, the Bitcoin protocol does not yet give Bob the right to add his proposed block to the chain.</p> <p>The consensus mechanism is designed to force the miners to compete for this right. By requiring the miners to work for the right to mine a new valid block, competition spreads across the network. This provides many benefits, including time for the transactions of users (like Alice) to disseminate around the world, thus providing a level of decentralization to the network.</p> <p>Therefore, although Bob would prefer to immediately create a new valid block and collect his reward, he cannot. He must win the competition by performing the proper work first. This is the source of the title of the Bitcoin-protocol consensus mechanism, &quot;Proof of Work&quot; (PoW).</p> <p>The competition that Bob must win is to be the first person to find an answer to a simple mathematical puzzle, designed by Satoshi Nakamoto. To solve the puzzle, Bob guesses at random numbers until he discovers a correct number. The correct number is determined by the internal complex formulas of the consensus mechanism and cannot be discovered by any means other than guessing. Bitcoin miners call this number a &quot;nonce,&quot; which is short for &quot;a ‘number’ you use ‘once.’&quot;</p> <p>Bob’s mining device will make random guesses at the nonce, one after another, until a correct nonce is found. With each attempt, Bob will first insert the proposed nonce into the rest of his block. To find out if his guess is correct, he will next use mathematical formulas (like those he used earlier) to compress his attempt into a &quot;block hash.&quot; A block hash is a small and manageable form of data that represents the entire history of the Bitcoin blockchain and all the information in Bob’s proposed block. A block hash can look like this:</p> <div class="language-bash extra-class"><pre class="language-bash"><code>000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
</code></pre></div><p>Recall now The Cascade Effect, and how it states that changing one small number in the data before performing the mathematical computations creates a vastly different outcome. Since Bob is continually including new guesses at the nonce with each computation of a block hash, each block-hash attempt will produce a widely different sequence of numbers. Miners on the Bitcoin network know when a miner, such as Bob, solves the puzzle; by observing the clues that were provided earlier. Recall that the last time a miner successfully added data to the blockchain, they provided these clues in their block header. One of the clues can look like this:</p> <div class="language-bash extra-class"><pre class="language-bash"><code><span class="token string">&quot;difficulty&quot;</span> <span class="token builtin class-name">:</span> <span class="token number">1.00000000</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This detail, &quot;difficulty,&quot; simply tells miners how many zeros should be at the front of the next valid block hash. When the difficulty setting is the level displayed above, it tells miners that there should be exactly ten zeros. Observe Bob’s attempted block hash once again, which he created after making a guess at a nonce, adding this proposed nonce into his block, and performing the mathematical formulas:</p> <div class="language-bash extra-class"><pre class="language-bash"><code>000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
</code></pre></div><p>The block hash above has ten zeros at the beginning, which matches the number of zeros in the difficulty level. Therefore, the hash that Bob proposed is correct. This must mean that he guessed a correct nonce. All the miners on the network can prove for themselves that Bob was correct by taking all the same information from their mempools, adding Bob’s nonce, and performing the mathematical calculations. They will receive the same result, and therefore Bob is the winner of this round.</p> <p>On the other hand, due to the Cascade Effect, if Bob’s attempted nonce had produced a block hash with the incorrect number of zeros at the front, his block hash would be invalid. The network would not afford him the right to add an incorrect block hash to the network, and all the miners would continue searching.</p> <h5 id="step-three-bob-finds-the-nonce"><a href="#step-three-bob-finds-the-nonce" class="header-anchor">#</a> Step Three: Bob Finds the Nonce</h5> <p>Once a miner discovers a nonce that produces a valid block hash, the miner has &quot;found a new block,&quot; and can send the signal across the Internet. The consensus mechanism running on every other mining device can verify for themselves the calculations. Once verified, the consensus mechanism grants the miner the right both to add the proposed block to the blockchain, and to receive the reward.</p> <p>Let us return to Bob’s machine, having just guessed a correct nonce, and thus holding a valid block hash. Bob’s machine instantly sends out the winning information across the Internet, and Bob collects his reward from the Bitcoin network. All the other miners must readjust. Earlier, they were searching for the correct nonce based off the information from the previous block header. However, Bob’s new valid block includes a new block header. All the other miners on the network abandon their current work, adopt Bob’s new block header, make many recalculations in their underlying data, and begin their search for the next nonce.</p> <p>There is no sympathy in the Bitcoin protocol for any miner’s wasted efforts. Suppose another machine on the network was also trying to mine Alice’s transaction, and lost to Bob in the race. Only Bob earns the reward from Alice’s transaction, and the other miner receives nothing in return for their costs and time.</p> <p>For Alice, this process seems simple. She first indicated the wallet address of her friend and sent cryptocurrency. After a certain amount of time, her friend received the money. Alice can ignore the byzantine process of the miners that occurred between these two events. Alice may not realize it, but the PoW consensus mechanism provides the foundation of security upon which she relies.</p> <h2 id="the-dominance-of-the-proof-of-work-consensus-mechanism"><a href="#the-dominance-of-the-proof-of-work-consensus-mechanism" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Dominance of the Proof-of-Work Consensus Mechanism</h2> <h4 id="proof-of-work-pow-fosters-ever-increasing-security"><a href="#proof-of-work-pow-fosters-ever-increasing-security" class="header-anchor">#</a> Proof of Work (PoW) Fosters Ever Increasing Security</h4> <p>There are several reasons why PoW networks, especially Bitcoin, continue to dominate in terms of security and blockchain success.</p> <p>A simple, preliminary reason is that PoW networks foster ever-increasing speed and computer power. Miners must constantly update and innovate above their competitors to continue earning rewards.</p> <h5 id="speed-and-power-are-of-the-essence"><a href="#speed-and-power-are-of-the-essence" class="header-anchor">#</a> Speed and Power are of the Essence</h5> <p>Among miners, having a faster and more powerful computer can mean earning rewards more frequently. For miners seeking to maximize profit, competition requires constant upgrades to machinery and to a miner’s customized underlying code.</p> <p>The frequency at which a device can create proposed block hashes is called &quot;hash power.&quot; The more hash power a collective PoW network has across all miners mining the blockchain, the more secure the network. This competitive pressure provides one important advantage in security to PoW networks, when compared to alternate consensus mechanisms.</p> <h5 id="the-network-effect-bitcoin-s-ability-to-dominate-begins"><a href="#the-network-effect-bitcoin-s-ability-to-dominate-begins" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Network Effect: Bitcoin’s Ability to Dominate Begins</h5> <p>A high level of security fosters a sense of trust among users, and this can grow a PoW network’s audience. As the audience grows, both the number of transactions and the price of the coin increase. This attracts more miners. The rising level of miners provides greater overall hash rate to the network, which in turn fosters a stronger sense of trust. This increased sense of security can raise the number of users on the network, which can increase the number of miners, and the cycle repeats.</p> <p>In economics, this is classified as a &quot;Network Effect,&quot; where a cycle of behavior encourages more of the same behavior, with compounding interest. Due to the Network Effect, and the fact that Bitcoin is the oldest PoW network, Bitcoin is increasing its security at a rate faster than the rate of other PoW networks.</p> <p>Furthermore, consider the effect caused when the price of a PoW-blockchain coin rises. Before the rise, assume the blockchain coin is worth one dollar. A miner is justified in spending the necessary money (on equipment, upgrades, and electrical costs, etc.) to justify one dollar’s worth of hash rate. If the price shifts upwards to two dollars, the miner must upgrade their entire business to justify two dollars’ worth of a matching hash rate. If the miner does not upgrade, their competitor will, and then the miner will no longer be able to compete for rewards.</p> <h4 id="the-longest-chain-rule-the-true-secret-sauce-of-pow-domination"><a href="#the-longest-chain-rule-the-true-secret-sauce-of-pow-domination" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Longest Chain Rule: The True &quot;Secret Sauce&quot; of PoW Domination</h4> <p>There are many more reasons why PoW networks continue to dominate in security.  Yet, for our discussion, there is one element that rises above all others. It is called, &quot;The Longest Chain Rule,&quot; and some blockchain developers may argue that it is &quot;the secret sauce&quot; that fuels PoW’s strength.</p> <p>The Longest Chain Rule is the determining factor whenever two competing versions of the blockchain history arise on the network. The rule simply states that whichever of the two versions grows longer first, wins. The other version is overwritten, and therefore all transactions and rewards on that version are erased.

Both are purchasing a car. The husband uses all the funds from the family Bitcoin wallet to purchase a car at precisely 8:00 PM (UTC). The wife makes her purchase at the exact same moment, for a similar amount.</p> <p>After making his purchase, the husband’s transaction hash is immediately sent to a mining device in China, where it is held in the miner’s local mempool. (Recall that a mempool is a collection of all raw transaction data across the network.)</p> <p>Let us suppose that the husband’s transaction arrives in the Chinese miner’s mempool at the exact moment that the Chinese mining equipment finds a correct nonce and a valid block hash. The Chinese miner declares the winning information, mines a new block, and collects a reward. All the miners in his local (Asian) vicinity (who receive the winning information faster than in the Americas, due to proximity) complete the block verification process, increase the length of the blockchain, and begin searching for the next valid block hash.</p> <p>On the opposite side of the world, essentially the exact same actions happen. The wife’s transaction is sent to the nearest miner, this time located in Washington state of the United States. Just as the transaction enters the Washington state miner’s mempool, the miner discovers a valid block hash. He sends out the signal, mines a new block, and also collects the reward (this is the same reward that the Chinese miner is attempting to claim). All the miners in the local (US) vicinity verify the information immediately and begin searching for a new valid block hash based on the Washington state miner’s recent block.</p> <h5 id="an-internal-conflict-of-interest-arises-within-the-bitcoin-network"><a href="#an-internal-conflict-of-interest-arises-within-the-bitcoin-network" class="header-anchor">#</a> An Internal Conflict of Interest Arises Within the Bitcoin Network</h5> <p>Note the paradox here. There are now two versions of the Bitcoin history that are valid, yet different.</p> <p>These two versions make their way across the Internet, around the world, each to the other side. When the competing messages arrive, the Bitcoin protocol sees that there is a conflict: the same money was spent twice.</p> <p>Consider how on each side of the world the miners are spending their financial and temporal resources to further their own interests. There is no economic incentive for either side to submit to the other, by nature. Therefore, there is a conflict of interest within the Bitcoin network itself. The Bitcoin network would swiftly fail, were it not for The Longest Chain Rule.</p> <h5 id="the-longest-chain-rule-the-history-which-is-longer-first-wins"><a href="#the-longest-chain-rule-the-history-which-is-longer-first-wins" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Longest Chain Rule: The History Which is Longer First, Wins</h5> <p>The Longest Chain Rule simply declares that whichever of the two competing blockchains grows longer first, wins. The consensus mechanism erases the other version.</p> <p>Let us suppose that the Chinese mining equipment is superior in this instance, and the Chinese miner manages to discover the next valid block hash and send out the signal before the Washington state miner can do likewise. Across the world, the moment the information arrives that the Chinese miner completed yet another valid block, the Bitcoin protocol erases the Washington state miner’s version of the Bitcoin history.</p> <p>There is no sympathy for any wasted efforts, nor for any misunderstandings between the wife and her car dealer. The Bitcoin protocol’s consensus mechanism simply presses forward. The Washington state miner’s rewards disappear, as though they never occurred. The wife’s purchase of a car likewise evaporates.</p> <p><em>(Typically, a normal and prepared car dealer utilizing cryptocurrency would not consider a customer’s transactions acceptable until several new blocks were added to the blockchain. In this manner, cryptocurrency users can ensure that a transaction is beyond contestation before the customer can, for example, drive a new car off the lot.)</em></p> <p>The Washington state miner gets a raw deal in this scenario, but the network benefits as a whole. The Longest Chain Rule provides the necessary security to prevent a Double Spend. The network accurately recorded one family member’s purchase of a car, prevented the mistaken double spend, and ensured that the most competitive miner received a just reward.</p> <p>This example illuminates the importance of The Longest Chain Rule.

Next, the malicious actor creates an alternate version of the PoW network’s history wherein those transactions never took place. Using advanced mining equipment, the malicious actor then &quot;attacks&quot; the PoW network by mining blocks to this &quot;false&quot; history faster than the rate at which other miners on the PoW network can mine blocks to the &quot;true&quot; history.</p> <p>Assuming the malicious actor has a sufficient hash rate, as this &quot;false&quot; history grows longer than the &quot;true&quot; history, the Longest Chain Rule will cause the consensus mechanism to overwrite the &quot;true&quot; version.

Therefore, the malicious actor would keep both their original funds and whatever item of value they exacted from their victim.</p> <p>This is known as the 51% Attack.

Therefore, we have seen but a few serious cases of the Genesis Attack.</p> <p>One notable instance occurred when an original Bitcoin developer, Luke-jr, used a variation of the attack to destroy a blockchain project called Coiledcoin.

Therefore, some competition among PoW networks is likely useful.</p> <p>However, as a human species, we can consider that there are more financially sound and eco-friendly methods of innovating with blockchain technology without always directly competing with Bitcoin PoW security. Our innovation, delayed Proof of Work, is one response to this fact, as we will soon discuss.</p> <h4 id="miners-are-free-to-mine-other-networks"><a href="#miners-are-free-to-mine-other-networks" class="header-anchor">#</a> Miners are Free to Mine Other Networks</h4> <p>Another inherent weakness of the PoW consensus mechanism to discuss is the ability of miners to choose alternate networks.</p> <p>In November of 2017, for a few hours the majority of Bitcoin network miners switched their hash power to a competitor’s PoW network, the <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/network-hashrate-charts/bitcoincash-network-hashrate-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Bitcoin Cash&quot;<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> network. This switch was the result of clever software engineering on the part of the Bitcoin Cash team.</p> <p>The team recognized that most miners are mining Bitcoin only because this network is the most profitable. Therefore, the team conducted a calculated change in the underlying protocol of Bitcoin Cash that caused its mining profitability to dramatically increase. The majority of the world’s Bitcoin miners recognized the higher profitability and switched to the Bitcoin Cash network instantly.</p> <p>While Bitcoin Cash’s play for a majority hash rate proved effective only for a matter of hours, their accomplishment raised awareness to a tacit principle in the network: Bitcoin’s hash rate is not bound to Bitcoin. The hardware is free to serve any compatible network the miners choose.</p> <p>At the time of the writing of this paper, between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, ~80% of the available hash rate is aligned with the former, and ~20% with the latter. There is speculation in the industry that if the Bitcoin Cash network creates a more favorable position, the balance of hashing power could change on a long-term basis. Furthermore, there are many other blockchain competitors who may gain the attention of Bitcoin’s miners in the future.</p> <p>Were a shift in the balance of hash rate to occur, Bitcoin would no longer be the leader of security in the cryptocurrency realm. The price of Bitcoin would likely drop as users realized the resulting lack of security leadership. This might cause more miners to switch to a more profitable network to cover the cost of operating their expensive hardware. As miners abandon Bitcoin, and as users continue to leave, the situation becomes a reversal of the Network Effect. The Bitcoin network would come crashing downwards at an ever-compounding rate.</p> <p>This is all theoretical, but it raises yet another concern that we need to illuminate: the security of a blockchain depends on many things, including the potentially fickle support of human blockchain miners. Our innovation, delayed Proof of Work (dPoW), takes this fact into account as we empower members of the Komodo ecosystem with Bitcoin-level security. Before we finally turn to our own solution, we must discuss the primary competitor to the PoW consensus mechanism, Proof of Stake (PoS).</p> <h4 id="the-primary-alternative-proof-of-stake"><a href="#the-primary-alternative-proof-of-stake" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Primary Alternative: Proof of Stake</h4> <p>Perhaps the most popular alternative consensus mechanism is Proof of Stake (PoS).  In this mechanism, blocks are mined not by miners performing work, but rather by any user &quot;staking&quot; their coins on the open network for the right to mine blocks.</p> <p>The meaning of &quot;staking&quot; has different variations depending on the specific rules set forth by the developers of the unique variant of the PoS consensus mechanism. In general, staking one’s coins means placing them as collateral on the open network in exchange for the right to mine new blocks.</p> <p>Users who stake their coins, thereby, can periodically extract a portion of the mempool, mine new blocks, and earn rewards. There is no need to perform any hardware-expensive proof-of-work calculations, as the user’s incentive to be honest is encouraged by the fact that their own wealth hangs in the balance.</p> <h4 id="the-security-risks-and-shortcomings-of-pos"><a href="#the-security-risks-and-shortcomings-of-pos" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Security Risks and Shortcomings of PoS</h4> <p>The downside to PoS is that a user who simply leaves a large portion of wealth staked (and therefore continually claims rewards) gradually becomes a centralized point of wealth through the power of compound interest. On PoS networks, monopolies are a constant danger. The owner of a monopoly has power over the well-being of the network.</p> <p>Once a majority of the supply is obtained, the owner gains a position known as &quot;Nothing at Stake.&quot; The owner can mine &quot;false&quot; blocks to the PoS blockchain and use their own majority supply over the network to declare these &quot;false&quot; blocks valid. All other stakeholders on the network must adopt these &quot;false&quot; blocks, lest the majority holder use their strength to declare competing blockchain versions as invalid.</p> <p>If a non-majority holder attempts to challenge the monopoly holder’s version, the non-majority holder can achieve little more than the loss of coins they placed at stake. Compare this with a non-majority holder in a PoW system: the question over the &quot;truth&quot; of the blockchain history depends not upon ownership of wealth, but upon the miner’s innovation and performance. PoW-based systems do not suffer from the risk of monopolies, therefore, as majority stakeholders gain no unique control over the mining of new blocks.</p> <p>Variations of PoS, including the popular Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT) systems, do not resolve the underlying issue of monopoly ownership and centralized manipulation. In a vanilla PoS system, the malicious actor needs only to purchase a majority supply of the coin to mine &quot;false&quot; blocks. Alternatively, as the PoS network grows to maturity, the collective of majority stakeholders will identify their financial equals, and they may find that they share a mutual interest in disadvantaging less financially established members of the network.</p> <p>In a DPoS/DBFT type system, wherein the ecosystem stakeholders elect and endow delegates with the responsibility to mine new blocks, the malicious actor has only to compromise the integrity of most of the delegates. Thereafter, the compromised delegates can mine &quot;false&quot; blocks, and the users of the ecosystem have no direct means to retaliate, beyond abandoning the network.</p> <p>This is not to say that PoS and its variants have no use cases. Indeed, there are scenarios in which PoS can be useful for entrepreneurs. In the Komodo ecosystem, our dPoW consensus mechanism can provide security to networks that use either type of consensus mechanism.</p> <p>After the following section summary, we finally turn our attention to dPoW.</p> <h2 id="a-summary-of-the-pow-consensus-mechanism"><a href="#a-summary-of-the-pow-consensus-mechanism" class="header-anchor">#</a> A Summary of the PoW Consensus Mechanism</h2> <p>In short, the PoW consensus mechanism, as designed by Satoshi Nakamoto, is currently the soundest method of blockchain security. The mechanism solves the Double Spend problem and creates a secure network, capable of transferring financial value. Furthermore, competition among miners and the Longest Chain Rule create fairness on the blockchain. The combination of features provides a high level of defense against two of the most dangerous methods of blockchain destruction—the 51% Attack and the Genesis Attack—assuming a strong overall hash rate on the network.</p> <p>New PoW blockchains can opt to compete directly with Bitcoin’s hash rate, and some level of competition is good for the ethical values and innovative power of the cryptocurrency industry. However, it is not necessary, cost-effective, nor eco-friendly that every new blockchain innovation requiring security should attempt to compete directly with Bitcoin. Not only is this unsustainable, but it is also unreliable, as it depends on the arbitrary choices of the decentralized network of miners around the world.</p> <h2 id="the-komodo-solution-delayed-proof-of-work-dpow"><a href="#the-komodo-solution-delayed-proof-of-work-dpow" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Komodo Solution: Delayed Proof Of Work (dPOW)</h2> <p>Komodo presents a technology, the delayed Proof of Work consensus mechanism, that solves the problems described above. Komodo’s unique consensus mechanism provides the same level of security as the strongest PoW network, without attempting direct competition. Instead, Komodo’s consensus mechanism uses the chosen PoW network as a storage space for &quot;backups&quot; of Komodo transactions. By this method, in the event of an attempted attack on Komodo’s blockchain history, even a single surviving copy of the Komodo main chain will allow the entire ecosystem to overwrite and overrule any of the attacker’s attempted changes.</p> <p>In a key difference separating Komodo from regular PoW networks, our dPoW consensus mechanism does not recognize the Longest Chain Rule for any transactions that are older than the most recent &quot;backup&quot; of the Komodo blockchain. For conflicts that may arise which refer to transactions that are older than the most recent &quot;backup,&quot; our consensus mechanism looks to the backups in the chosen PoW blockchain (Bitcoin) to find the accurate record.</p> <p>Furthermore, entrepreneurs who build independent blockchains (Smart Chains) in the Komodo ecosystem can likewise elect to have backups of their own records inserted into the Komodo main chain. In this manner, the records of the entrepreneur’s chain are then included in the backup that is pushed into the protective hash rate of the main PoW blockchain (Bitcoin). Thus, entrepreneurs and developers in the Komodo ecosystem can have their independent blockchains protected by the hash rate of the chosen PoW blockchain (Bitcoin).</p> <p>Therefore, to destroy even the smallest Smart Chain that is employing Komodo’s dPoW security, the attacker would have to destroy: a) all existing copies of the Smart Chain; b) all copies of the Komodo main chain; c) the accompanying PoW security network into which the dPoW backups are inserted (Bitcoin). This endows the Komodo ecosystem with higher than Bitcoin-level security, while avoiding the excessive financial and eco-unfriendly costs.</p> <p>In addition, the dPoW security provided by Komodo is not only greater than Bitcoin, but is also more flexible. The Komodo security services are performed by notary nodes, chosen through a stake-weighted vote. Notary nodes have the freedom to switch notarization to another PoW network. Reasons the notary nodes might elect to switch networks could include an event where worldwide miners’ hashing power changes to another PoW network, or the cost of notarization to the current PoW network becomes more than necessary. Through this flexibility, the Komodo ecosystem maintains both a superior level of security and a more flexible and adaptive nature than Bitcoin itself.</p> <h4 id="a-note-about-komodo-s-iguana-core-technology"><a href="#a-note-about-komodo-s-iguana-core-technology" class="header-anchor">#</a> A Note About Komodo’s Iguana Core Technology</h4> <p>All the following processes are supported by a deeper Komodo technology called Iguana Core. Readers of the entire Core Technology Discussion sections will note that Iguana Core is featured in each section. This is because Iguana Core is the heart of the underlying technology that enables the vast Komodo ecosystem to work together. The Iguana Core code itself is complex and to fully explain would require a separate whitepaper.</p> <p>In short, Iguana Core is a collection of code that serves many purposes. One function of Iguana Core is to empower the blockchain technologies Komodo either builds or adopts to act in coordination with each other. Often, Iguana Core can advance their initial capabilities beyond original expectations. In the case of dPoW, the code that underlies notary-node functionality spawned from Iguana Core technology.</p> <p>Iguana Core is coded in the C programming language—the language of choice of our lead developer, JL777. The C language is designed to enable computers to process high volumes of information in a secure manner at high speed.

The specific clue, &quot;difficulty,&quot; changes with each block header.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances on a PoW blockchain, with each block header the difficulty level can change. The Bitcoin protocol itself decides what the difficulty for the next valid block should be.</p> <p>The difficulty is decided based on the amount of overall hash power mining the network. If many miners are active, then the hash rate is high, and the Bitcoin protocol sets the difficulty to a higher number. On the other hand, if the hash rate is low, then the protocol sets the difficulty to a lower number.</p> <p>Recall that the &quot;difficulty&quot; level determines the number of zeros at the beginning of the next valid block hash. The more zeros at the beginning of a valid block hash, the more unlikely each attempt at finding a valid block hash will be.</p> <p>When the Bitcoin protocol was in its infancy, the difficulty setting was easy.

This is so simple, in fact, no special computer is required. Early Bitcoin miners could use nothing more than the average desktop machine, having the CPU—the small heart of the computer—performing the calculations.</p> <p>As more miners joined the network, however, the Bitcoin protocol automatically increased the difficulty. This maintained the speed at which the pool of all miners discovered new blocks, despite the increased size of the pool. Stabilizing the speed created several benefits, including an amount of economic predictability upon which users can rely.</p> <p>Today, at Bitcoin’s current level of overall hash power, a valid block hash requires a much higher level of difficulty.

In addition to performing the notarizations of the Komodo ecosystem, notary nodes are also a special type of blockchain miner. They have a certain feature in their underlying code that both enables them to maintain an effective and cost-efficient blockchain ecosystem and provides the notary nodes with a financial incentive. The combination of benefits prevents the Komodo ecosystem from falling into the trap of directly competing with other PoW networks for hash-rate security status.</p> <h4 id="each-notary-node-gets-one-chance-per-every-sixty-five-blocks-to-mine-on-easy"><a href="#each-notary-node-gets-one-chance-per-every-sixty-five-blocks-to-mine-on-easy" class="header-anchor">#</a> Each Notary Node Gets One Chance Per Every Sixty-Five Blocks to Mine on Easy</h4> <p>Each individual node periodically receives the privilege to mine a block on &quot;easy difficulty.&quot; In other words, while the rest of the miners in the Komodo ecosystem are mining at a calculated difficulty level, the notary nodes occasionally receive the chance to mine as though they are alone on the network.</p> <p>The notary nodes’ &quot;easy difficulty&quot; setting operates in a cyclical manner, with each notary node on its own cycle. At the start of the cycle the notary node holds the &quot;easy difficulty&quot; ability until it mines one &quot;easy&quot; block. Then the Iguana Core code removes the ability for the next sixty-four blocks. After the sixty-four block period passes, the notary node can once again attempt to capture a block on &quot;easy difficulty.&quot;</p> <p>Therefore, while everyone else on the network mines at an adjustable level of difficulty according to the normal PoW consensus mechanism (which keeps the overall speed of the Komodo network stable) the notary nodes have a chance to step outside the normal rules. For every sixty-five block period on the Komodo blockchain, the odds that a block will be mined by a notary node, as opposed to a normal miner, are essentially 3:1.</p> <p>Since the rest of the miners have an adjustable difficulty ratio, it does not matter how many more miners attempt to mine Komodo. Most of the valid blocks will always be found by the sixty-four elected notary nodes, even were the entire hash power of the Bitcoin network to switch all its attention to mining Komodo.</p> <p>The mining rewards that a notary node receives through this feature are ~50 KMD per day. This reward occurs regardless of KMD’s popularity, market value, or even of the competition from normal KMD miners. The reward notary nodes receive creates an economic incentive for each party controlling a notary node to support and protect the Komodo ecosystem, and to increase the relative value of this daily ~50 KMD reward.</p> <h2 id="komodo-s-protective-measures-in-action"><a href="#komodo-s-protective-measures-in-action" class="header-anchor">#</a> Komodo’s Protective Measures in Action</h2> <p>There are myriad ways that an attacker can assail a blockchain project, and the Komodo ecosystem is well prepared.

In the Genesis Attack, the attacker recreates the genesis block of a blockchain and mines an entirely false history.</p> <p>For either of these attacks to play any part in the Komodo ecosystem, the successful attack would have to destroy every transaction at every level it is recorded.</p> <h5 id="defense-against-the-genesis-attack"><a href="#defense-against-the-genesis-attack" class="header-anchor">#</a> Defense Against the Genesis Attack</h5> <p>First, let us consider the implications of the notarization process provided against the Genesis Attack.</p> <p>Once an independent blockchain has even just a single transaction pushed through the notarization process into the chosen PoW network, that notarization protects against the Genesis Attack.</p> <p>To successfully complete a Genesis Attack against a Komodo Smart Chain, the attacker would have to destroy the chosen PoW network’s records from that moment going forward. The attacker would also have to destroy the KMD main chain from that moment forward, and the entire independent Smart Chain.</p> <p>The likelihood of achieving this task is effectively as probable as performing a Genesis Attack on the chosen PoW network itself.</p> <h4 id="defense-against-the-51-attack"><a href="#defense-against-the-51-attack" class="header-anchor">#</a> Defense Against the 51% Attack</h4> <p>The Komodo ecosystem is also well protected against the 51% Attack. Consider an attacker attempting to create a malicious transaction on a default PoW-based Smart Chain in the Komodo ecosystem. The attacker creates their transaction and sends it to the Smart Chain's PoW network for processing.</p> <h5 id="before-notarization"><a href="#before-notarization" class="header-anchor">#</a> Before Notarization</h5> <p>During the waiting period for notarization, on a default PoW-based Smart Chain, this transaction is vulnerable to the attacker's 51% Attack. The attacker would simply wait until the opportune moment to attack their victim by providing 51% of the total hash rate to a &quot;false&quot; version of the independent Smart Chain wherein the transaction never occurred. This &quot;false&quot; version would erase the transaction before the notary nodes create the next notarization, and therefore the unfortunate recipient of the transaction would no longer have the funds from the vanished transaction.</p> <p>On a default PoW-based Smart Chain, therefore, the recipient of any transaction should always wait until the notarization process is underway before exchanging their valuables.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p> <p>An important aside here is that Komodo Smart Chains have additional settings beyond the default PoW-based setup that reduce the time required to wait for notarizations.

Now, the attacker must successfully perform the 51% Attack against both the KMD main chain and the independent Smart Chain.</p> <p>Attacking the KMD main chain is difficult to achieve, as it is not a normal PoW blockchain. Rather, this chain is designed to withstand attacks. The attacker would have to compromise many of the notary-node machines while simultaneously performing a 51% Attack against both the KMD main chain and the independent Smart Chain.</p> <p>While the KMD main chain provides a certain level of protection, this chain is not the ultimate goal. The KMD chain is merely a transfer point before moving the notarization data to the BTC main chain, as BTC is dramatically more secure. Therefore, while entrepreneurs, developers, and users await notarization to BTC, they should decide for themselves how much trust they wish to place in the system at this point of the process.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p> <p>A frequent concern that many newcomers have here can be described as a fear that the notary nodes could potentially falsify information about a transaction on a Smart Chain.</p> <p>This concern sometimes mistakenly leads some observers to believe that notary nodes are a centralized group who are providing financial governance to the ecosystem.</p> <p>This is neither true nor possible.</p> <p>Notary nodes are <b>not</b> arbiters of truth.</p> <p>As stated before, all information that goes into a notarization is generated by the Smart Chain network and is publicly verified by all nodes on the network. This includes the notarization itself.</p> <p>Notary nodes' sole additional power is the ability to sign a transaction that records this notarization to the network. Either notary nodes perform this service, or they do not. There are no other options available to them.</p> <p>Any attempt by the notary nodes to falsify information in a notarization would be automatically rejected by all users of the Smart Chain network.</p></div> <h5 id="notarization-to-btc"><a href="#notarization-to-btc" class="header-anchor">#</a> Notarization to BTC</h5> <p>After another ten to twenty minutes, the notary nodes will perform the notarization process for the KMD main chain. Here, they gather all the information for the entire ecosystem, create a hash, and record this hash to the BTC main chain. Once this is completed, they inform the entire ecosystem through a special transaction on the KMD main chain, and on each individual Smart Chain.</p> <p>At this point, one can argue that the attacker's job is nigh impossible. To 51% Attack the Smart Chain, the attacker must compromise BTC, KMD, and the Smart Chain. This would require an incredible amount of equipment and expertise, and therefore most users in the Komodo ecosystem may now feel safe to consider all transactions to have achieved permanent finality.</p> <p>Therefore, any record that has at least one full notarization has a fortress of security at its guard. So long as users and developers are mindful to wait for the desired number of notarizations to secure their payments, both the 51% Attack and the Genesis Attack are highly unlikely either to be successful, or to provide economic value to the would-be malicious actor.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we remind all users of our ecosystem to consider their own vigilance and mindfulness as the most effective protection against the would-be attacker. Users, entrepreneurs, and developers utilize all aspects of the Komodo network at their own risk.</p> <h4 id="considering-an-attack-on-the-notarization-process"><a href="#considering-an-attack-on-the-notarization-process" class="header-anchor">#</a> Considering an Attack on the Notarization Process</h4> <p>To create a notarization for the KMD main chain, the minimum number of notary nodes required is 13. If the notary nodes themselves come under attack and must work to maintain access to the Internet, just 13 of the full 64 are required for the Komodo ecosystem to continue its operations.</p> <p>In the possible event of a disconnect from the minimum number of notary nodes, chains in the Komodo ecosystem should simply be on the alert. Users, developers, and entrepreneurs would simply need to wait for the notary nodes to regain access to the Internet and resume the notarization process before considering any transaction final.</p> <p>For this reason, the position of a notary node is held with high importance, and the parties which gain these positions are measured foremost by their Information Technology experience and capabilities. Komodo stakeholders are responsible to vote for candidates that are the most qualified to perform in the notary-node duties.</p> <h2 id="the-dpow-consensus-mechanism-is-inherent-in-all-komodo-smart-chains"><a href="#the-dpow-consensus-mechanism-is-inherent-in-all-komodo-smart-chains" class="header-anchor">#</a> The dPOW Consensus Mechanism is Inherent in all Komodo Smart Chains</h2> <p>The notarization for the Smart Chain is performed by the notary nodes as a service to the independent developer and entrepreneur.</p> <p>Notary nodes create a notarization of the Smart Chain and write it into the KMD main chain. Then they write their actions into the Smart Chain itself. This allows Iguana Core (running at the heart of the Smart Chain) to identify where its most recent notarization can be found.</p> <p>The notarization process cycles every ten minutes, assuming the Smart Chain’s network is consistently active. If the network has periods of inactivity, the notary nodes halt the process (to save against unnecessary notarization costs) and reactivate as soon as new transaction activity appears on the Smart Chain’s network.</p> <p>We invite the reader to consider that as each Smart Chain can support thousands of transactions per minute, this makes the combined ecosystem capable of supporting millions of transactions per minute. This includes cross-blockchain interoperability and Smart Chain clustering, via our atomic-swap powered technology and our Antara Framework. This makes Komodo among the most scalable of financial-technology solutions in existence, and capable of competing with the transaction volumes of fiat networks.</p> <p>Naturally, as each level of notarization takes time to perform, there is an additional delay for Smart Chains as compared to the KMD main chain. A Smart Chain’s history is notarized into the KMD main chain approximately every ten minutes, assuming constant activity. This notarization will then be pushed through the notarization process into the chosen PoW network (Bitcoin). We estimate that a transaction performed on a Smart Chain will receive the KMD main chain’s protection within approximately ten minutes, and will receive the Bitcoin hash rate’s protection in approximately twenty to thirty minutes.</p> <p>Another difference between the KMD main chain and a Smart Chain is that the notary nodes only mine the KMD main chain. Asset-chain developers are responsible to create any required network of miners to process their Smart Chain’s transactions.</p> <p>This does not need to be a full network of mining farms, such as those in Bitcoin. Rather, power only needs to be of a level necessary to process transactions, and to provide any desired level of hash-rate security. For a small business with intermittent periods of transaction activity, a single, dedicated, full-time server may be enough. Larger businesses can scale as desired and can also work to attract a network of freelance miners.</p> <p>Furthermore, developers of Smart Chains need not create their chain so that it relies solely on a PoW consensus mechanism. Instead, developers can utilize Antara Customizations (discussed later in the Core Technology Discussions section and elsewhere in this documentation). These Antara Customizations allow the developer to utilize a hybrid consensus model that combines Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Proof-of-Work (PoW).</p> <p>The PoS consensus mechanism does not require high electrical costs to maintain a basic level of network security. Therefore having a certain percentage of blocks mined via PoS can increase security during the ten-minute waiting period before notarization.</p> <p>There are also various members of the Komodo ecosystem who mine for profit, and can be motivated to assist Smart Chain developers in securing a network in exchange for block rewards.</p> <p>This combination of options available to a blockchain entrepreneur dramatically reduces the overhead costs and effort the entrepreneur and developer would otherwise have to allocate to a network of high-hash rate miners.  These freed resources of the entrepreneur and developer can therefore be allocated to other uses in their business models.</p> <p>The total yearly cost for the Komodo notary nodes to notarize the KMD main chain into the currently chosen PoW chain, Bitcoin, is approximately ~180 BTC/year (a value of ~$1.5M USD at the time of the writing of this paper). Funding for the notary nodes to perform this service was raised during the Komodo ICO, and current BTC holdings give us many years to come before we will be required to implement any business models to replenish our BTC funds.</p> <p>On the other hand, the total cost for the Smart Chain developer to notarize their independent chain into the KMD main chain is but a fraction of the cost. This security mechanism is not limited to Smart Chains created within the Komodo ecosystem. In fact, Komodo’s Blockchain Security Services are available to any existing blockchain. With Komodo, any blockchain can be protected with the power of the Bitcoin hash rate for a tiny percentage of the cost.</p> <p>Thus, an entrepreneur in our ecosystem can have their own independent blockchain that is backed up by the hash rate of the Bitcoin mining network, at only a fraction of the cost. In the following sections, we discuss the formation of a new Komodo Smart Chain, the method of distribution and trading using our atomic-swap technology, AtomicDEX, and our &quot;smart contract&quot; like technology, the Antara Framework.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/komodoplatform/developer-docs/edit/master/docs/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/delayed-proof-of-work.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Suggest an improvement for this page</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">a year ago</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
